# Ceylon Circuit - System Patterns

## Architecture Overview

### Frontend Architecture
1. Component Structure
   - Atomic Design Pattern
   - Reusable UI components
   - Container/Presenter pattern
   - HOC (Higher Order Components) for shared logic

2. State Management
   - Redux for global state
   - Context API for theme and auth
   - Local state for component-specific data
   - Custom hooks for reusable logic

3. Routing
   - React Router for navigation
   - Protected routes for authenticated users
   - Dynamic route generation
   - Route-based code splitting

### Backend Architecture
1. API Structure
   - RESTful API design
   - Resource-based endpoints
   - Versioned API routes
   - Standardized response formats

2. Database Design
   - MongoDB collections structure
   - Document relationships
   - Indexing strategy
   - Data validation schemas

3. Authentication Flow
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Role-based access control
   - Token refresh mechanism
   - Secure password handling

## Design Patterns

### Frontend Patterns
1. Component Patterns
   - Compound Components
   - Render Props
   - Controlled Components
   - Uncontrolled Components

2. State Management Patterns
   - Redux Actions/Reducers
   - Middleware for async operations
   - Selectors for derived state
   - Normalized state shape

3. Performance Patterns
   - Memoization
   - Lazy loading
   - Virtualization
   - Code splitting

### Backend Patterns
1. API Patterns
   - Controller-Service-Repository
   - Middleware pipeline
   - Error handling
   - Request validation

2. Database Patterns
   - Repository pattern
   - Data access objects
   - Query builders
   - Aggregation pipelines

3. Security Patterns
   - Input validation
   - Output sanitization
   - Rate limiting
   - CORS configuration

## Component Relationships

### Frontend Components
1. Layout Components
   - App Shell
   - Navigation
   - Sidebar
   - Footer

2. Feature Components
   - Authentication
   - Trip Planning
   - Booking System
   - Profile Management

3. Shared Components
   - UI Elements
   - Forms
   - Modals
   - Notifications

### Backend Services
1. Core Services
   - Authentication
   - User Management
   - Content Management
   - Booking System

2. Integration Services

   - Email Service
   - AI Chat Service
   - Analytics Service

## Data Flow
1. Frontend to Backend
   - API requests
   - Form submissions
   - File uploads
   - Real-time updates

2. Backend to Frontend
   - API responses
   - WebSocket events
   - Server-sent events
   - Push notifications

3. Database Operations
   - CRUD operations
   - Aggregations
   - Transactions
   - Data migrations
